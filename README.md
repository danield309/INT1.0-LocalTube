# LocalTube
Welcome! This program will allow you to instert a youtube link and download it to your desired location on your machine. It will also let you choose between qualities and formats. Motivation to build this program comes mostly since YouTube doesn't allow users to download videos unless they are on a payed subscription. Sometimes I would like to watch tutorials offline when I'm on the subway or even a plane.
